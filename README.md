`# 🏋️‍♂️ BurpeeBet

**BurpeeBet** is a social nutrition tracking app that turns dieting into a challenge of accountability, pain, and partnership.

## 💡 Concept

BurpeeBet is like _MyFitnessPal_ meets _friendly punishment_.

You and a friend (or stranger) challenge each other to stick to personal calorie goals over a set period:  
**2, 4, or 8 weeks** — or a custom duration.

Each user sets their **own daily calorie goal**. If either of you fails to stick to it, there are **penalties**.

### 🔥 Example:

- You exceed your weekly goal by **500 calories**.
- Your friend exceeds theirs by **300 calories**.
- The penalty is shared: you both must burn 800 calories — through running, walking, or doing **burpees**.
- The pain you cause your partner keeps you accountable — and vice versa.

It’s dieting with social pressure and real consequences.

## 🧩 Core Features

### 1. 👯 Challenge System

- Create or join a **challenge** (2/4/8+ weeks).
- Invite a friend via **shareable link**.
- Set **personal calorie goals**.
- Track challenge progress together.
- See each other's compliance and penalty stats.

### 2. 🍗 Nutrition Tracker

- Log **calories and macros** (like MyFitnessPal).
- Search food database and scan barcodes.
- View daily and weekly totals.
- Log meals with ease.

### 3. ⚖️ Penalty Engine

- Auto-calculate overages.
- Convert excess calories to:
  - 💪 Burpees (e.g. 1 burpee per 10 calories)
  - 🏃 Distance or time-based cardio
- Add total challenge penalties together.

### 4. 📱 Friendly & Competitive UI

- Simple challenge **dashboard**.
- Show visual progress (e.g. “25 burpees owed this week”).
- Keep it fun, but motivating.

## 🧪 MVP Goals

- Launch as a **free app** using Expo + React Native.
- iOS support via Expo Go.
- Focus on:
  - Basic food logging
  - Challenge setup/invite
  - Weekly penalty calculation

Future versions may include:

- Push notifications
- Paid tiers (e.g., customized penalties, advanced stats)
- Integration with wearables (Apple Health, Fitbit, etc.)

- Expo CLI (latest stable version)
- React Native with JavaScript
- ESLint with React/React Native rules
- Prettier for code formatting
- iOS simulator configuration

## Prerequisites

- macOS with Node.js installed
- Xcode installed
- iOS Simulator available

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Run on iOS simulator:
   ```bash
   npm run ios
   ```

## Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Start the Expo development server
- `npm run ios` - Run on iOS simulator
- `npm run android` - Run on Android emulator
- `npm run web` - Run in web browser
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint to check code quality
- `npm run lint:fix` - Run ESLint and automatically fix issues
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run format:check` - Check if code is properly formatted

## Development

The app includes a simple HomeScreen with a button that tracks tap count. This serves as a starting point for building your nutrition tracking features.

## Code Quality

The project is configured with:

- ESLint for code linting with React and React Native specific rules
- Prettier for consistent code formatting
- Pre-commit hooks can be added later if needed

## iOS Simulator
